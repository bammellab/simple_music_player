# Installation Guide

This guide explains how to download and install Simple Music Player directly from GitHub releases onto your Android device.

## Download the APK

1. Go to the [Releases page](../../releases) on GitHub
2. Find the latest release
3. Under "Assets", tap on `MusicPlayer-vX.X.apk` to download it to your device

## Enable Installation from Unknown Sources

Android blocks app installations from sources other than the Play Store by default. You need to enable this setting for your browser or file manager.

### Android 8.0 and newer

1. When you try to install the APK, Android will prompt you to allow installations from this source
2. Tap **Settings** on the prompt
3. Enable **Allow from this source**
4. Go back and proceed with installation

### Alternative method

1. Open **Settings** > **Apps** (or **Apps & notifications**)
2. Tap the three-dot menu and select **Special access** (or find it under **Advanced**)
3. Tap **Install unknown apps**
4. Select your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) or file manager
5. Enable **Allow from this source**

### Android 7.1 and older

1. Open **Settings** > **Security**
2. Enable **Unknown sources**
3. Confirm the warning dialog

## Install the APK

1. Open your file manager or Downloads app
2. Navigate to the downloaded `MusicPlayer-vX.X.apk` file
3. Tap the file to begin installation
4. Review the permissions and tap **Install**
5. Once installed, tap **Open** to launch the app

## Permissions

When you first open the app, it will request permission to access your music files:

- **Android 13+**: "Read music and audio" permission
- **Android 12 and below**: "Storage" permission

Grant this permission to allow the app to find and play your music.

## Updating the App

To update to a newer version:

1. Download the new APK from the Releases page
2. Install it over the existing app (your settings will be preserved)
3. You don't need to uninstall the old version first

## Troubleshooting

### "App not installed" error

- Ensure you have enough storage space
- If you have an older version installed from a different source, uninstall it first
- Make sure the APK download completed fully (try downloading again)

### "Parse error" or "There was a problem parsing the package"

- The APK may be corrupted - download it again
- Your Android version may be too old (requires Android 7.0 / API 24 minimum)

### App crashes on launch

- Ensure you're running Android 7.0 (Nougat) or newer
- Try uninstalling and reinstalling the app

### Can't find any music

- Make sure you granted the audio/storage permission
- Check that your music files are in a standard format (MP3, M4A, OGG, FLAC, WAV)
- Music must be stored on the device (not only in cloud storage)

## Uninstalling

To remove the app:

1. Long-press the app icon
2. Tap **Uninstall** or drag to the uninstall area
3. Confirm removal

Or go to **Settings** > **Apps** > **Simple Music Player** > **Uninstall**
